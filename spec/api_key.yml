# ! IMPORTANT !
# Copy this file to "api_key.yml" in the same directory. This file ("sample_api_key.yml")
# is not even used, and if you put your real API info into it there's a fair chance you'll
# wind up accidentally committing it. The "api_key.yml" file is already in .gitignore, so
# you won't do so if you remember to copy this file first.
#
# Note that it doesn't really matter what any of this stuff is if $mock_services is true,
# which it really always should be unless you need to test end-to-end connectivity.
#
# Note, also, that the tests were designed around mock data. They WILL fail if you use real
# data. However, you should be able to judge pretty easily by the error messages whether
# they're failing because of the data mismatch, or whether they're failing for some other
# (more catastrophic) reason.
